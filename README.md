# üèÜ Challenge: Manipulating the Widget collections.

* This is a pairs-challenge..
    * Get seated by your partner
    * Set a timer (5 minute intervals)
    * Remember, one person navigates, one person codes
* You will use Ruby enumeration methods to manipulate collections of data.
* You have been provided with a scaffold code file to get you started (*scaffold.rb*)
* You are **not** required to modify any code file other than the scaffold file *scaffold.rb*.
* Complete the series of tasks below...

<br>

## PART 1 - Widget Array

In part 1 we will be working with an **array of Widget objects**.

The array of objects have already been provided in the code scaffold (*scaffold.rb*).

### .each and .each_with_index
1. Print all widgets.
1. Print all widgets, along with their index.
1. Accumulate the valueaud of all widgets. Print the result.
1. Increment the valueaud of all widgets by 1.
1. Increment the valueaud of widgets by 1 where weightgms is greater than 2.
1. Decrement the valueaud of widgets by 1 where heightcms is between 10(inclusive) and 15(exclusive).

### .select
1. Get all widgets where the name includes the string 'widget'. Return the results in a new array (non-destructive).
1. Get all widgets where the name includes the string 'widget' and the description contains the string 'curious'. Return the results in a new array (non-destructive).
1. Reduce the collection of widgets to only those where the name includes the string 'widget' and the description contains the string 'ous' and lengthcms is less than 50 (destructive).

### .map
Note: You should get a fresh collection of widgets before performing the following.

1. Increment the lengthcms by 1 and then copy the lengthcms of each widget into a new array.
1. Sort the array into ascending order (destructive).
1. Print the sorted new array.
1. Accumulate the total of all values in the new array.
1. Find the greatest value and decrement it by 1 (destructive).

## Part 2: Widget Array of Hashes

In part 2 we will be working with an array of hashes where each hash contains the data for a widget.

The array of hashes has already been provided in the code scaffold (*scaffold.rb*).

1. Print the keys and values for each widget hash.
1. Place all widget hashes into a new array, but only the ones where valueaud is greater than 8.0
1. Print the keys and values belonging to the new array.
1. Accumulate the total of valueaud in the new array and then print the result
1. Place all widget hashes into a new array, but only the ones where valueaud is greater than 3.0 and lengthcms is less than 10.
1. Print the keys and values belonging to the new array.
1. Accumulate the total of valueaud in the new array and lengthcms and then print the result.

# ü§£ Programming in pairs!

It's a **collaborative** pairing, however...

...there are **two roles** in the pair...

üöò The **Driver**...writes the code and explains the code being written.

üß≠ The **Navigator**...watches as the code is being written, and calls out any mistakes and misunderstandings.

Roles are swapped at regular, predetermined intervals.

Only the Driver is allowed to touch the keyboard!

## Why pair program?

* Improves code quality
* Improves team knowledge of the code-base
* Promotes incidental sharing and learning

## How to...

1. Get comfortably seated around 1 computer
2. Establish the time interval
3. Decide Driver and Navigator
4. Ensure that you can both see the problem description
5. Set your timer
6. Work as a pair until the timer sounds
7. Swap roles reset your timer
8. Work as a pair until the timer sounds
...

## About the timer

It is important that the timer can be heard and controller by each party - for this reason, mobile phone timers are not recommended.

Search for *"pair programming timer"* in Google.

## Common concerns

> *"My pair mate is more capable. It would be a better use of time if I let my team mate do most of the driving"*

But **you** will not gain the benefits of the pairing - which is to learn about the code base.

> *"My pair mate is less capable. I'm not sure how to include them in the solution I have planned"*

It is your *responsibility, honour and challenge* to teach your partner; one step at a time, the solution you are planning.

> *"There is code in our solution that I do not understand"*

Ask your partner *"What is this code doing?"*, and ask often.

Celebrate all wins!
